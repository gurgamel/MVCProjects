You have to run all this crap just to create the project.
The Angular part of the project ends up in SprotsStore/ClientApp.
The MVC part is the rest of it.

ng new SportsStore --skip-git --skip-commit --skip-tests --source-dir ClientApp

cd SportsStore

npm install --save-dev webpack@2.3.2 aspnet-prerendering@2.0.3 aspnet-webpack@1.0.28 webpack-hot-middleware@2.17.1

ng eject

npm install

dotnet new mvc --language C# --auth None --framework netcoreapp1.1

The above line fails "netcoreapp1.1 is not a valid option for --framework".
This might be becasue I have installed VS2017 which installs Core 2.0,
even though I clicked the option to include Core 1.1 as well.

Ran it again without the --framework. It has completed without errors
but I don't know if it will work.
Looking at the project file in notepad I can see that it is targeting Core 2.0.

Next...
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices --version 1.1.0
This installs a whole raft of dependencies, and it says it has downgraded some of them.

dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore --version 1.1.1
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 1.1.1
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --version 1.1.1

Now we have to go and hack the csproj from within VS2017.

I cannot get started with the Angular book.
Decided to try Jquery UI.
